                Secret side project to help my latest venture.
                I built this application for the MVP stage and present it to the company's board of directors.
                Currently, the project has been validated and has entered the beta testing phase by a small group of users
                Production launch planned for the first quarter of 2020
              </p>
              <h4>What's the problem ?</h4>
              <p>
                Let me add some context.
                This company is a construction company whose main client is the public authority.
                French legal framework is really strict, construction companies responding to public contracts must provide CVs of the team in charge of the work.
                Thus, in order to highlight the capacity of the personnel mobilized by the operation, public work firms needs to provide resumes when responding to the project's call for tenders.
                It must focus on their experiences with comparable projects. It is not a CV for job search.
                Currently, every tender bidder build it on his laptop each time he needs it.
                It's time-consuming, value-free, almost never up to date, and not effective.
                No data sharing between teams, no consistency.
              </p>
              <h4>What's the solution ?</h4>
              <p>
                This application generates perfectly up-to-date CVs for the selected team in less than 4 steps.
                The design reflects to the graphic chart of the company.
                Users can add new experiences to a worker's profile in 2 clicks.
                Sometimes some information is missing or partially missing and there is a data confidence system (red, orange, green flag) to prevent the recording of bad data.
                This reliability index of the information that is added by everyone, which allows faster and more accurate data cleansing.
                The application is supported by a database.
